ISU Judging System, used to score the performance of figure skaters at international competitions like the Winter Olympic Games

1. Using a loop, ask the user to input scores from nine judges. Scores do not have to be whole numbers

    a. In the loop's output, identify each judge by their number, from 1 to 9, when asking for their score
  
    b. Validate each judge's input within 0.0 to 10.0
  
    c. Keep a running sum of all the scores entered by the judges
  
2. After the nine scores are entered, subtract the value of the highest and lowest scores from the sum
  
3. Average the remaining sum for 7 judges and output the final score
